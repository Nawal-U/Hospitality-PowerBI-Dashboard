## Business Insights
- Guests often choose third-party platforms even when prices are the same. By adding perks like breakfast, welcome drinks, and airport transfers, direct bookings could be made more attractive—keeping the room rate steady at ₹12,500.
- Low property ratings are hurting revenue. For example, Atliq Seasons has a 2.30 rating, putting it at high risk, while properties rated 3.0–3.5 are losing moderate revenue. Improving service and training staff could help close this gap.
- Weekday occupancy is 20–35% lower than weekends. Programs like “Work from Hotel,” mid-week corporate packages, and partnerships with IT/consulting firms could make these days more profitable.
- Nearly 1 in 4 bookings (24.84%) gets canceled, leading to revenue loss. Tiered cancellation policies, converting refunds to credits, or offering optional insurance could help retain more revenue.
